                      I have been professionally developing web applications for the past 10 years.  I enjoy working with small businesses and helping them make their dreams a reality.  My experience working as a consultant has taught me how to avoid many of the the pitfalls (see my <a href="#section3">mission statement</a>) that ensare business owners as they try to start or improve their websites.

                    <p>
                      I am a firm believer in iterative development and keeping my clients in tune with every step of the process.  This approach allows me to build what my clients really need and not waste any time or resources.

        My primary goal is to clear a path towards success for your business.  So... that is an obvious and vague statement (or insert other sarcastic comment here).  But, go on...
      </p>

      <p>
        The path that businesses must traverse is littered with failed attempts.  There are a myraid or reasons for failure, but I can only speak towards those of a technical nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have seen consultants over-engineer solutions that eat up funding and resources before the web application ever sees the light of day.  I have also worked on many projects where the original developers did not have the proper skill set to build a solid foundation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>My Pledge:</strong><br>
        I will only advocate solutions that gives your business the best chance of success, <em>at that time</em>.  I will never choose a technology for its own sake or just because this is the "right" solution.  I will only build software that can move your business forward.

            This was a pro-bono project that I spearheaded along with a few other developers.  We built a pet rescue site that has many features not typically found in similar sites, including: Admin and Volunteer accounts, API that pulls data from major pet rescue sites, and event planning system (users could schedule dogs for adoption events) just to name a few.

            Zenzi is a "values-based marketing company."  This was a home-grown CMS system that I inherited.  I was charged with updating several social media (LinkedIn API,  Twitter API).  I also added new features and fixed existing bugs.

            This site provides basketball coaches the ability to organize drills and plans to create more efficient practices. In an step-by-step process I re-wrote and replaced problematic pieces of the application while adding new features.  I believe the work done on this application has now given them a solid foundation.
